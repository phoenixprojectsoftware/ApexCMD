# ApexCMD
## About
ApexCMD is a game engine built using the Windows Command Prompt. The engine is primarily used for developing text games and animations using ASCII art. It was originally created by @sabian-heatwave in 2016 for Apex Modding (which then renamed to creaTive Computer Entertainment), but since that company has merged into PHOENIX, they are the active developers of the engine.
## Developing
To develop for ApexCMD, you will need Windows 7 SP1 or later and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 or later. Using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community is recommended. In Visual Studio, select "CHECK OUT CODE" and choose the ApexCMD SDK folder. Cloning this repository with Git Bash or Git GUI is recommended, though you can clone this repository using Visual Studio. Once this repository is cloned and put into Visual Studio, you will have full access to the example game and the base game where you can start your game for ApexCMD.
## Rules for the discussions in the Issues and Pull Requests pages
There are basic rules that MUST be followed at ALL TIMES by everyone who participates in the discussions. Please remember the following:
- Do not insult, harass or demean anyone.
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists. A developer from The Phoenix Project (someone with a username that ends with "-heatwave" or "-phoenix") will let you know if they have noticed the issue.
